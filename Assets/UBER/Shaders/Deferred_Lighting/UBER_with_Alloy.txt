Use "Deferred Shading UBER.shader" from Alloy installation to have Alloy with UBER features working (included and matching in Alloy 3.2.6)

If you'd like UBER shaders to keep the same light falloff in FORWARD (for example transparent materials) look into UBER_StandardConfig.cginc and set #define UBER_MATCH_ALLOY_LIGHT_FALLOFF 1
